## Official repository for Reproduction of CVPR2023 paper: "Towards Artistic Image Aesthetics Assessment: a Large-scale Dataset and a New Method"

## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to reproduce the results of [Original Paper/Algorithm Name] using existing codebases. Our goal was to verify the results by evaluating the original code, testing it against different datasets, rewriting the code for efficiency and readability, and performing an in-depth hyperparameter sensitivity analysis.

## Methodology

### Existing Code Evaluation

- **Description**: We began by evaluating the existing code from [source/repository]. Our evaluation process involved...
- **Findings**: During the code evaluation, we noticed...

### New Data Evaluation

- **Data Collection**: We sourced additional datasets from [data source] to assess the model's robustness and generalizability. The new datasets include...
- **Results on New Data**: The model's performance on new datasets showed...

### Code Refactoring

- **Refactoring Process**: The existing code was refactored to enhance [performance/readability]. Key changes included...
- **Impact of Refactoring**: Post-refactoring, we observed changes in [execution time/memory usage].

### Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis

- **Approach**: We systematically varied hyperparameters such as [list a few hyperparameters] to understand their impact on model performance.
- **Key Insights**: The sensitivity analysis revealed that...

## Results

Provide a brief overview of the results, perhaps with tables or figures if appropriate.

### Reproduced Results

- **Original vs. Reproduced**: Compared to the original implementation, our reproduced results are...
- **Challenges Encountered**: We faced challenges such as...

### New Data Results

- **Consistency Across Datasets**: The model's consistency across various datasets was evaluated, revealing...

### New Code Variant Results

- **Performance Comparison**: With the refactored code, the performance [improved/remained consistent] because...

### Hyperparameter Analysis

- **Critical Hyperparameters**: Our analysis highlighted [hyperparameter] as particularly influential because...

## Discussion

Discuss any discrepancies, unexpected findings, or conclusions drawn from the reproduction effort.
